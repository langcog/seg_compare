===========

Full codebase for Frank et al. (2010), Cognition 

Note that some parts of this repo are very messy - there are many false starts on the modeling work that eventually went into the paper. Experiment code can be found in the "expts/expt code" directory. Repo also includes some simple recurrent network simulations that didn't make it into the paper as well as a number of different implementations of the PARSER model from Perruchet & Vinter (1998). 

If you're looking for just the experimental data, I recommend this repo:
