Now it's time for the test.  We'll play you two strings and your job is to 
decide which one sounds more like a word in the language you just heard. To
choose the first one, press the key marked with the '1' sticker, and to 
choose the second one, press the key marked with the '2' sticker. 

Press any key to go on.
